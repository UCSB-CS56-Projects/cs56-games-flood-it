1. A game where the board starts covered randomly with different colors. The objective is to fill the board with one color.
2. *As a user, I can open the game interface using ant run in the command line so that an unfinished interface pops up.
*You can click different colors, but they don't currently do anything besides record which color was clicked in the log.
3. The game does not run. An interface can be opened but it has no functionality.
4. *Most importantly, a feature that needs to be added is full functionality for the game, since it does not run yet.
   *A high (or low) score feature would add competitiveness and make the game more fun.
   *Sound effects, a soundtrack, or animations would make the game more fun and add a level of polish.
5. The readme.md is very incomplete. It describes the game that the game that the project is intending to accomplish, but does not mention the project's status in any way. It also includes a link to an example webapp of the game in a completed form. It does include a few details on how the project was made so far, but needs a lot more detail.
6. The build.xml file has targets compile, run, test, and javadoc. The targets all function right now. There are some properties at the beginning related to jws that can (presumably) be removed.
7. There are 5 issues already: Fill the grid; write more unit tests; bug: buttons and instructions; update javadoc; and fix gui view, and controller so the game works. The first and last issues are the biggest and the game won't function at all until they have been solved. There are a total of 1120 points so we should have enough work.
8. n/a, might add some features
9. The code so far passes all the tests written so far, but there are only 9 tests and they only cover 2 of the 7 classes that have been written. The directory structure doesn't make that much sense; for instance, the controller folder has one class called FloodItCmdLine but it doesn't do anything. Given the current state of this project it would make a lot more sense to put all the classes in the same folder. Additionally, many of the integral classes simply do not function. The code that has been written is pretty easy to follow but not necessarily the cleanest or most efficient. For example, in the FloodItGrid class there is a method that uses a lengthy block of if/else if/else statements that could be refactored to be more readable and hopefully more efficient. The code that is complete/mostly complete is commented but not in the javadoc style. This could easily be improved. To another programmer we would say that this project is supposed to be a flood-it game written in Java but it is incomplete. The gui still needs to be completed, most test cases are missing, the file structure makes little sense, and the javadoc is basically empty.
10. The test coverage is severely lacking. Of the 7 classes, only 2 of them have tests and these tests do not cover all cases. We know the tests are incomplete because all of them can pass right now but the program does not work. We would go about expanding test coverage by writing tests for the classes that do not have tests, and then looking for more edge cases for the classes that do have tests. Even for the classes that do have tests there are methods that need better test coverage to ensure they will fill their contract with the other classes they interact with.
